1. Rewrite hyper log log to have hospitals and central guy, but need to figure out what hash to use etc, maybe look for existing code
2. extend to hyper log log ++ (DONE)
3. Run experiments on: what happens when u remove/replace a guy, 
    what are the tradeoff visualizations for being more k anonymous and sacrificing accuracy, 
    what are the effects of harmonic mean, what are the effects when u have much larger populations, 
    what are the effects of having a really rare disease/query vs more common

TODO list:
3.3 k anonymous and accuracy trade off
3.4 what are the effects of harmonic mean, what are the effects when u have much larger populations
3.5 k anonymous and buckets



DONE:
1. have central guy (hospitals will send buckets, but may need to do extra things in case they are sparse)
2. add k anonymity
3.1 remove/add patient
3.2 what are the effects of having a really rare disease/query vs more common / proportion of unique patients
